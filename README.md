Image FIlter using fourier transformation

After first leanrning about fourier transformation,I though it would be a good ideaa to use it as a image transformation Since it deals with sinusodial waves. 

I made a simple image filter that can do low pass and high pass filter, and made a very simple UI with the capability to see a preview which helps with the ability to chose properly. 

I chose to use Pyqt5 because thats the only on that could work on multi-platform.
